# Property and property user messages(GeneralPropertyInformation)

If property messages should be accessed by reference like in the tutorial, I think a new table should be done, one that has many messages and a single property.

General property information doesn't need to know what user gave favorite or wishlisted it.

- [x] Table has a single property
- [x] Table has many messages
- [x] Table has many ratings
- [x] Table has many comments
